permalink: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9949177
excerpt: 'This paper is the first work of my whole research career. We focus on semantic segmentation task and try to prove that an decoder for specific task can be very simple. We utilize a simple MLP decoder for swin transformer encoder in this work, named SSformer, and experiments show that the lightweight SSformer is still powerful.'
