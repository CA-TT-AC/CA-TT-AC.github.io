title: "CADTalk: An Algorithm and Benchmark for Semantic Commenting of CAD Programs"
collection: publications
permalink: https://enigma-li.github.io/CADTalk/
excerpt: 'Given a CAD program as input, our algorithm – CADTalker – automatically generates comments before each code blocks to describe the shape part that is generated by the block. We evaluate our algorithm on a new dataset of commented CAD programs – CADTalk – that contains both human-made and machine-made CAD programs.'
